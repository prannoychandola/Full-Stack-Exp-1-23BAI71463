Experiment Description

In this experiment, a full-stack single page application (SPA) was developed using React with Vite to understand modern frontend development and deployment practices. The project structure was organized using reusable components, pages, assets, and styles to maintain modularity and scalability.

The application was built using React functional components, JSX, and basic routing concepts. Styling was handled using CSS files, and the project followed standard folder conventions used in real-world React applications.

After development, the project was successfully deployed on GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. The deployment process automated the build and hosting of the application directly from the GitHub repository whenever changes were pushed, eliminating the need for manual deployment commands.

This experiment provided hands-on experience with:

Setting up a React project using Vite

Understanding project structure and component-based architecture

Version control using Git and GitHub

Automated deployment using GitHub Actions

Hosting a frontend application on GitHub Pages

Overall, this experiment helped in understanding the complete workflow of developing, managing, and deploying a modern web application.
